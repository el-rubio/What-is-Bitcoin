 <p><li>Bitcoin is the worlds first Cryptocurrency and it works because of the worlds first Blockchain network.</li><li>What does Bitcoin do? It's simple it lets you send and receive value to and from anyone in the world using nothing more than a computer an an internet connection.</li> 
  <li>Why is it revolutionary? Unlike every other tool used for sending money over the internet. It works without the need to trust a middleman, the lack of any corporation in between means that Bitcoin is the world's first public digital payments infrastructure.</li><li>By public I mean available to all and not owned by any single entity. We have public infrastructure for information, for websites, for email, its called the internet. But the only public payments infrastructure that we have is CASH (paper money) and it only works in face to face transactions. Before Bitcoin if you wanted to pay someone remotely over the phone or the internet then you could not use public infrastructure you will rely on a private bank to open their books and add a ledger entry that debits you and credits the person that your paying, and if you both dont use the same bank well then their will be multiple banks and multiple ledgers in between. With Bitcoin the ledger is the public blockchain and anyone can add an entry to that ledger transfering their bitcoin to someone else and anyone regardless of their nationality, race, religion, gender, sex, or credit worthiness can absolutely for no cost create a Bitcoin address in order to receive payments digitally. 
    <li> Bitcoin is the worlds first globally accessible public money. 
  <li> Is it perfect NO! But neither was email when it was invented in 1972, Bitcoin is not the best money on every margin its not yet accepted everywhere, its not use often to quote prices, and its not always a stable store of value but it is working and the mere fact that it works without trusted intermediaries is Amazing! Its a computer science breakthrough and it will be as significant for freedom, prosperity, and human flourishing as the birth of the Internet. Bitcoin is just the beginning. </li>  </p>
